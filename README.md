## HowTo:
- Download XML from GitHub: https://github.com/PaladinTitus/SC_X56/blob/master/SC_3-18-0_Eramur_x56.xml (right click the "Raw" button above the code and choose "save target at...")
- Copy XML to INSTALL_PATH\StarCitizen\LIVE\USER\Client\0\Controls\Mappings (or PTU if you want to)
- Get into the game
- Open console (^)
- Type "pp_rebindkeys SC_3-18-0_Eramur_x56" (do NOT append ".xml"!!!) - You can use copy & paste here for the file name (CONTROL + V)
- Confirm with ENTER
- Close console (^)
- Enjoy!

Still not working? Please try this solution:

- Are both devices detected correctly?
- If you are not sure, please test here: https://html5gamepad.com/ (push a button on each device to make them visible)


If they show up, try a different approach:
- Instead of loading the config via console, go to options - keybindings - advanced controls customization - control profiles and select "SC_3-17-1_Eramur_X56".
- In the opening window select: Keyboard -> Keyboard ||| Mouse -> Mouse ||| Joystick -> Joystick ||| Joystick -> Joystick (1)
- Confirm with "Load".
